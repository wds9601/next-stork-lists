This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a template Next.js starter app with linting, Prettier formatting, and Tailwind CSS set up already.

I plan on using Next quite a bit more often for my projects going forward,, so I thouhgt id build out this template to save myself some time doing the setup.

It includes
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

integrated out of the box.  

Just clone the template and start coding your spiffy new website/app with Next and TailwindCSS!

## Getting Started
First, run `npm install` on the project directory to install all the dependency packages.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
